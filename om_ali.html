        <h3>Ingredients instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Unroll 1 puff pastry sheet onto a lightly floured surface and roll out to about 17x12-inches. Place on a baking tray.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until puffed and golden brown, about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Break puff pastry into pieces and place in a large bowl. Add raisins, almonds, pine nuts, pistachios, and coconut; toss until well combined. Spread evenly in a 9x13-inch glass baking dish.</li>
            <li>Pour milk into a saucepan; stir in sugar and vanilla. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until hot but not quite boiling. Pour over puff pastry mixture in the baking dish.</li>
            <li>Return to the oven and bake for 15 minutes. Turn on the broiler and continue baking until the top is browned, about 2 minutes. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving warm.</li>
